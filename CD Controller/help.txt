CD Controller
Use:
Run it, look for window.
Keys:
O: Open CD drive.
C: Close CD drive.
E or escape: exit.
S: Status.
Space: Toggle if the word "Sending..." is spoken when sending a command. Default is enabled.


Please note that if the program gets stuck and won't exit, wait about 10 seconds, and whatever command you pressed will exicute after the other one is finished. This is a bit weird.
Please also note that if you get an error while closing the CD drive, you may have to close the drive yourself.

Have fun!
