# Misc BGT
An archive of old code I wrote years ago.

## Notes
* This code was written for the BGT programming language; released by Blastbay. It is no longer supported.
* Along the way, I used some public includes. From what I can tell, I used two versions of speech.bgt, mci_player.bgt and readable_time somewhere too.
* This code is very bad. Most of it was written a while ago, and when I was very new at programming.
* I am actually putting it here to demonstrate how bad it is.
* Some of the dialogues are not helpful, as you may expect.

Got any bad BGT code you want to put here? Send in a PR! I'll add it, because why not.
